(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

# Estimated Timeline

Using a mix of the agile scrum and prototype process models we anticipate the following sprints:

**Sept. 23nd - Oct 6th:**

> - Create base code.

**Oct. 7 - Oct 13th:**

> - Create the first world using an established json map and unique graphics and sound.

**Oct. 14th - Oct. 15th:**
> - Decide on an overall scoring system

**Oct. 16th - Oct. 23rd:**
