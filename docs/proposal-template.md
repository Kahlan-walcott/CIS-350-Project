# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept) (Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)

# Anticipated Technologies

The anticipated technologies needed to complete this project include: the IDE Pycharm, the open-source python library pygame, and json maps. 

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

Our teams plans on having a lot of changes based on our own abilities and time constraints, a very much code as we go approach. An AGILE SCRUM method fits best into this fast past project we have set. Overall our plan of attack will be to divide tasks and aim to get them done within a certain time frame. We can then go back and evaluate any issues or constraints we had while moving forward into the next period of coding and testing. It is of note that our goals and time frames will change throughout the project based on where we are at. This is because we are prepared to change a lot of the features of our video game based on our individual abilities.

# Estimated Timeline

Using a mix of the agile scrum and prototype process models we anticipate the following sprints:

**Sept. 29th - Oct. 6th:**

> - Create base code.

**Oct. 7th - Oct. 13th:**

> - Create the first level using an established json map and unique graphics includiong little artifacts the character(dog) can pick up to "fuel" itself to get through the level.

**Oct. 14th - Oct. 15th:**
> - Decide on an overall scoring system and have the first level working.

**Oct. 16th - Oct. 23rd:**
> - Learn how to create different json map templates for the second level.

**Oct. 24th - Nov. 8th:**
> - Create the second level using unique json maps, graphics, and sound.

**Nov. 9th - Nov. 16th:**
> - Code a menu that has an object that can be rolled and have the user ‘fall into’ the next level.

**Nov. 17th - Nov. 22nd:**
> - Store and update the data of the player as they get through the levels. Once they have finish all the tasks in the second level, they win the game.

**Nov. 22 - Dec. 1:**
> - Decide on adding additional data storage to create a running scoreboard and or additional functionality. 


# Anticipated Problems

The Anticipated Problems include:
* Getting the code to work on all computers
* Have a general coding style that we all understand
* Putting descriptive comments above every line so everyone knows what that line is doing
