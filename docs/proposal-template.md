# Introduction

## Project Concept
In our game, a dead dog is brought back to life and embarks on a journey to reunite with its original owner. The dog must navigate through a mystical forest filled with magical creatures and challenges. Along the way, it will collect various artifacts needed to pass through special gateways guarded by these creatures. Players can help the dog go back and forth in the forest to gather any missed artifacts, making exploration an essential part of the game. These mystical creatures act as gatekeepers, allowing the dog to advance to the real world only after it has fulfilled certain requirements, such as presenting artifacts or answering trivia questions.
Instead of having separate levels, the game will feature multiple steps or gateways within the same mystical forest. Each gateway will present its own challenges, and the dog must prove itself to gain access to the next part of its journey. The dog’s adventure will include different worlds, such as the Cloud World representing its afterlife and the Underworld, adding depth and variety to the gameplay experience. This setup enhances the emotional connection as players guide the dog through its trials to ultimately find its way back home.
## Loosely Defined Features
### Essential:
* Artifact Collection: Players must collect artifacts needed to pass through mystical gateways.
### Desirable:
* Mystical Creatures: Each gateway is guarded by a creature that asks for artifacts or trivia questions to let the dog pass.
### Optional:
* Multiple Worlds: Include various themed areas like the Cloud World (afterlife) and the Underworld, adding more layers to the dog’s journey.


# Anticipated Technologies

The anticipated technologies needed to complete this project include: the IDE Pycharm, the open-source Python library Pygame, and .json file maps.

We plan on using PyInstaller to turn our final game files into executable files. We will create .EXE files for Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. To do this, we must have access to 3 computers that run either Mac, Windows, or Linux operating systems. 

Additionally, we will be using the agile management tool, Jira, to coordinate tasks as a team. We will also be using GitHub for our version control software. 

# Method/Approach

We will employ an AGILE SCRUM method as it best fits the fast pace and small group size of this project. 

We will divide and complete tasks in pre-determined timeframes, known as sprints. We will regularly evaluate the constraints we encounter within each sprint and use this evaluation to continuously improve our development process. It is noted that our goals and time frames will change throughout the project based on changing requirements. We are prepared to adapt the features of our video game based on factors like individual ability and customer feedback. 

Additionally, we will be incorporating elements of the prototype process model via sharing our evolving game with customers and adapting based on their feedback. 

We will meet via Zoom twice a week for in-depth planning. We will also maintain a Jira board to keep a live showcase of tasks to be completed and who is assigned to complete them. 

All members of the team will take turns developing tests, source code, and documentation for the project. This will allow equal learning for all group members.

Lastly, we will use Slack as an avenue for daily check-ins where everyone can briefly share what they will be prioritizing for that day. 



# Estimated Timeline

Using a mix of the agile scrum and prototype process models we anticipate the following sprints:

**Sept. 29th - Oct. 6th:**

> - Create base code.

**Oct. 7th - Oct. 13th:**

> - Create the first level using an established .json map and unique graphics. These graphics will include special artifacts. The user will collect these artifacts to progress to the next level. 

**Oct. 14th - Oct. 15th:**

> - Decide on an overall scoring system and have the first level working.

**Oct. 16th - Oct. 23rd:**

> - Learn how to create different .json map templates for the second level.

**Oct. 24th - Nov. 8th:**

> - Create the second level using unique json maps, graphics, and sound.

**Nov. 9th - Nov. 16th:**

> - Code a menu that has an object that can be rolled allowing the user ‘fall into’ the next level.

**Nov. 17th - Nov. 22nd:**
> - Store and update the data of the player as they play through the levels. Create a congratulations banner to be displayed upon completion of the second level. 

**Nov. 22 - Dec. 1:**
> - Decide on adding additional data storage to create a running scoreboard and or additional functionality. Create .EXE files. 


# Anticipated Problems

The Anticipated Problems include:
* Getting the .EXE files to run on all operating systems.
* Coordinating our individual coding styles into a unified format.
* Putting descriptive comments above every line so everyone knows what each line is doing. 
* Learning the required technical skills necessary to implement all desired functionality. 
* Finding free graphics and sound. 
* Assigning realistic individual tasks based on everyone's technical background.

* Coming to a complete agreement on all aspects of the game's creative vision.
* Communicating our individual struggles so we can get help from others.
